# PredictiveAnalysis-PredictDengueSpread
For this project we used Negative Binomial Regression, Regression with Time Series, and ARIMA with regression variables to predict the Dengue virus spread.

dengue.R is our main R file which contains all our prediction algorithms, our data cleaning steps, and our data visualizaition steps.
DengAI.docx is our report that we created for this project.
dengue_features_train.csv, dengue_labels_train.csv, and dengue_features_test.csv is our training data and our test data for this project respectively.
We got all our data from www.drivendata.org
